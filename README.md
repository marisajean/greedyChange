# greedyChange
Use a greedy algorithm to make change. 

# Input - Level 1, Non-OOP

Your program should be able to take in a list of coin values, and a target change value. 

# Input - Level 2, OOP

You should create not just a list of coin values, but various coin objects with value fields. Your program should take in a list of coin objects and a target change number. 

# Output 

Your function should output the greedy algorithm solution for how to make change with the fewest number of coins from the list provided. 


# Sample Input 
Given the list coins = [.25, .05, .10, .01, .25] and the target value t = .36 your program should return the ordered list result = [.25, .10, .01] 

The object oriented program should return result = ["quarter", "dime", "penny"]
